== KMeans

This is another KMeans implementation.  I have a few things that I need to work on:

* Extract the NodeList information out of the Node to make it more flexible
* Work on an online version of this code

The basic idea is that I wanted to solve a problem for a client, but I didn't want to throw the code away.  So you get this.

==Usage

This is a funny way to get random data:
@node_list =  (1..100).map { while (n = rand(10) + 1) == 4 or n == 6; end; p n} 
@kmeans = KMeans::Agent.call(:k => 2, *@node_list)
puts @kmeans.clusters.inspect
